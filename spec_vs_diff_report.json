  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of requirements well. All five core requirements (REQ-1 through REQ-5) are addressed with meaningful implementations. The primary gap is that the product placeholder image is referenced with a dimensional suffix filename rather than the plain filenames specified in REQ-5. Additionally, unauthenticated visitor product viewing is not fully functional since getProducts requires a principal. The profile tagline field (distinct from bio) is also absent as a separate field.",

      "requirement": "Hero banner image must be loaded from frontend/public/assets/generated/hero-banner.png and default product placeholder from frontend/public/assets/generated/product-placeholder.png",
      "reason": "The code references 'hero-banner.dim_1200x400.png' in ProfileHero.tsx and 'product-placeholder.dim_400x400.png' in ProductCard.tsx, not the plain filenames specified in REQ-5.",

      "requirement": "Unauthenticated users see a fully rendered read-only profile and product showcase",
      "reason": "In App.tsx, products are only fetched when principal is available (authenticated). Unauthenticated visitors have no principal, so useGetProducts returns nothing and the product showcase will be empty for visitors rather than showing the owner's products.",
